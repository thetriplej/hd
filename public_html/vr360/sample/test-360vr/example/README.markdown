jQuery Reel Examples
====================

Reel has all the available examples centralized here in the `example/`
folder as of version 1.2. This means you will not find any examples in the
`test/` folder anymore. Everything moved here.

- Each subfolder represents a completely self-contained example, which can
eventually be taken out and re-used easily with little or no modification.
Each example has all it needs inside that folder.
- For simplicity examples are nearly completely naked without any ballast
other than stylesheet, example texts and image credits.
- All examples link for jQuery 1.7 and latest Reel from respective CDNs.

visible for your reference. To hide it simply remove this option.
